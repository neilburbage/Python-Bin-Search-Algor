**Binary Search Algorithm (Iterative and Recursive)**

This mini project shows two classic divide and conquer implementations of binary search:

| File          | Method        | Purpose                                         |
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------------------------------------------|
| `bin-iter.py` | **Iterative** | Loops until the target is found                 |
| `bin-rec.py`  | **Recursive** | Calls itself on ever smaller slices of the list |

Binary search halves the search space at every step; and gives O(log n) time complexity.

This is fundamental to efficient database searches, search engines and real time apps.

**Quick start**

python bin-iter.py # run the iterative demo

python bin-rec.py # run the recursive demo
